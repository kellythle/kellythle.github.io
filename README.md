# Small Travel Designations Website
Here you will find a website I made back in 2018 for my computer science class about travel designations 
I would like to travel to one day. It is a simple, small website I used to learn how to use and apply HTML 
and CSS and also explore different functions websites could have such as popups/alerts, input fields, and more!

Hope you enjoy it!
